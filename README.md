# -Library-management-system_Enterprise-Programming
This software project will be implemented in Java EE for managing and maintaining libraries in any educational institution through an integrated computerized system. The library management software will allow librarians to operate  more productively while handling the typical day-to-day tasks of a library.

In a traditional library management system, everything is done manually. All the library operations and records, including the number of books, genres of books, names of books, records of the students whoâ€™ve issued/returned books, etc., are all done via pen and paper. Naturally, this process requires a significant amount of time, effort, and even human resources.

The proposed project seeks to solve all the challenges associated with the traditional library management system. Since it stores and manages all the library records in a computerized database,  it eliminates the need for manual record- keeping. The software includes different modules, each of which handles and manages specific library operations.

By using this software application, librarians and students need not search the entire library to find a book. They can enter the name and author of the book, and the system will display the list of all the possible books available for that search keyword/phrase. This is one of the best features of this library management software.
